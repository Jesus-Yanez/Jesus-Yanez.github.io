## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1, part 1
  
  This was our first lab for this class, I loved it due to its simplicity and the frinedship I gained out  of it. It also reminded me of my first time coding, which is a pleasant memory.

* Lab 12, part 1
  
  This Lab was a challenge, I had a hard time figuring out how to write my code for this Lab. However       seeing the picture I made me, made me happy.

* Lab 5, part 1
  
  This Lab was on the medium side of difficulty, I enjoyed programming this in order to find the area,   length and width of the rectangle. It was a super fun lab that both me and my partner enjoyed.
