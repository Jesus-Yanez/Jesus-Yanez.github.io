## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1, part 1
  
  This was our first lab for this class; I loved it because of its simplicity and the friendship I gained. I learned that you could make a simple message with code and that coding is team-oriented. It also reminded me of my first time coding, which is a pleasant memory for me. 

* Lab 12, part 1
  
  This Lab was a challenge; I had difficulty writing my code for this Lab. However, I had fun at the same time. I learned how to code a flipbook-style color picture and use Magick in C++. It made me realize that coding is involved in places you wouldn't think of. 

* Lab 5, part 1
  
  This Lab was on the medium side of difficulty; I enjoyed programming this Lab to find the rectangle's area, length, and width, which also helped me learn how to calculate the sum of something from the user inputs. It was a super fun lab that both my partner and I enjoyed.
